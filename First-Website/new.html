<h1>Hardware Terminology</h1>
<h2>input device:</h2>
<img src="input device image.jpg" width="500px">
<p>An input device is a device that could turn our human languages into computer language(which is 1 and 0)in order for us to communicate and control the computer</p>
<h2>output deivce:</h2>
<img src="output device image.jpg" width="500px">
<p>An output device is the opposite side of input device. Input device turn human languages into computer language(1 and 0), output device turn computer language into human languages.</p>
<h2>Central Processing Unit(CPU):</h2>
<img src="CPU image.jpg" width="500px">
<p>A Central Processing Unit is a device that run the code of the computer. If input and output devices are the one which make the command in a computer;Central Processing Unit is the one that run those commands in a computer.</p>
<h2>Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU):</h2>
<img src="ALU image.jpg" width="500px">
<p>An Arithmetic Logic Unit is a circuit that runs mathematical calculation on integar binary numbers inside a computer.</p>
<h2>Control Unit:</h2>
<img src="control unit image.jpg" width="500px">
<p>A Control Unit is a unit that gives commands to input and output devices or Centrol Processing Unit m,which I mentioned above, to tell them what they shouldl do. It is used as a unit to carry commands to other devices or units to make sure they receive the command correctly.</p>
<h2>Random Access Memory:</h2>
<img src="RAM image.jpg" width="500px">
<p>A Random Access Memory is a computer memory that used to store data and allows the user to change it any time.</p>
<h2>Optical Memory:</h2>
<img src="optical memory image.jpg" width="500px">
<p>An Optical Memory(or storage) is a memory that uses laser beams to store memories. It stores the memory by making patterns that could be read by the help of the laser light.</p>
<h2>Magnetic Memory:</h2>
<img src="magnetic memory image.jpg" width="500px">
<p>Magnetic Memory is a memory that uses cores to store memory and access them by using electric to magnetize them.</p>
<h2>Flash Memory:</h2>
<img src="flash memory image.jpg" width="500px">
<p>A Flash Memory is a memory that could be stored when the computer dies and restored when the computer restarts.</p>
<h2>Logic Gates:</h2>
<img src="logic gates image.png" width="500px">
<p>A Logic Gate is a circuit that has one or more input device and only one output device. depending on the signal it receives from the input device, it gives the result with and/or/not.</p>
